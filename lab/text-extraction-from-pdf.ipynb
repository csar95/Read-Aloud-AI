      "While conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able \n",
      "to perform the same workflows on the users’ behalf with a high degree of independence.\n",
      "Agents are systems that independently accomplish tasks on your behalf.\n",
      "A workflow is a sequence of steps that must be executed to meet the user’s goal, whether that's \n",
      "resolving a customer service issue, booking a restaurant reservation, committing a code change, \n",
      "\n",
      "or generating a report.\n",
      "\n",

      "chatbots, single-turn LLMs, or sentiment classifiers—are not agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "More concretely, an agent possesses core characteristics that allow it to act reliably and \n",
      "consistently on behalf of a user:\n",
      "01 It leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions. It recognizes \n",
      "when a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case \n",
      "\n",
      "of failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the user.\n",
      "02 It has access to various tools to interact with external systems—both to gather context \n",
      "and to take actions—and dynamically selects the appropriate tools depending on the \n",

      "The Agents SDK treats guardrails as first-class concepts, relying on optimistic execution by \n",
      "default. Under this approach, the primary agent proactively generates outputs while guardrails \n",
      "\n",
      "run concurrently, triggering exceptions if constraints are breached. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardrails can be implemented as functions or agents that enforce policies such as jailbreak \n",
      "prevention, relevance validation, keyword filtering, blocklist enforcement, or safety classification. \n",
      "For example, the agent above processes a math question input optimistically until the \n",

      "Plan for human intervention\n",

      "Human intervention is a critical safeguard enabling you to improve an agent’s real-world \n",
      "performance without compromising user experience. It’s especially important early \n",

      "in deployment, helping identify failures, uncover edge cases, and establish a robust \n",
      "evaluation cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementing a human intervention mechanism allows the agent to gracefully transfer \n",
      "control when it can’t complete a task. In customer service, this means escalating the issue \n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "Agents mark a new era in workflow automation, where systems can reason through ambiguity, take \n",
      "action across tools, and handle multi-step tasks with a high degree of autonomy. Unlike simpler \n",
      "LLM applications, agents execute workflows end-to-end, making them well-suited for use cases \n",
      "that involve complex decisions, unstructured data, or brittle rule-based systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To build reliable agents, start with strong foundations: pair capable models with well-defined tools \n",
      "and clear, structured instructions. Use orchestration patterns that match your complexity level, \n",
      "starting with a single agent and evolving to multi-agent systems only when needed. Guardrails are \n",
      "critical at every stage, from input filtering and tool use to human-in-the-loop intervention, helping \n",
      "ensure agents operate safely and predictably in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path to successful deployment isn’t all-or-nothing. Start small, validate with real users, and \n",
      "grow capabilities over time. With the right foundations and an iterative approach, agents can \n",
      "deliver real business value—automating not just tasks, but entire workflows with intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "and adaptability. \n",
